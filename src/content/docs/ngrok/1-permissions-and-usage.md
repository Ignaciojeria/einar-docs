Use EinarCLI to generate an Ngrok tunnel, allowing your local network to be accessible from anywhere in the world. First, ensure your application has the necessary permissions to access Ngrok resources. Below, we outline the available options to facilitate this process in your application.

# üåê Ngrok Installation
Inside your project directory, run the following command to include Ngrok in your project:

```sh
einar install ngrok
```

This will generate the following files and directories within your project, setting up the necessary infrastructure for Ngrok interaction:
```sh 
/app
  /shared
    /infrastructure
      /ngrok
        - tunnel.go
```

## üîí Permissions Setup

The Ngrok installation requires an Authtoken as an input parameter. To obtain the Authtoken, you need to create an account on the  [Ngrok HomePage.](https://ngrok.com/)

After generating your Authtoken, verify that the .env file in the root of your project contains the `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` environment variable:
```sh 
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="<TOKEN>"
```

When running the application using go run main.go, you will see something like this:
```

  / __/___/ /  ___
