EinarCLI allows you to select the folder where components will be generated. This applies to all components created by Einar.

## 👨‍💻 Select folder for any Einar component.

We are going to select the folder for HTTP controllers, organizing components for `orders`, `payments`, and `customers`.

Inside your project directory, run the following commands to create new controllers within the `orders`, `payments`, and `customers` folders:
```sh
einar generate post-controller orders/create-order
einar generate post-controller payments/create-payment-request
einar generate post-controller customers/create-customer
```

The files `create_order.go`, `create_payment_request.go`, and `create_customer.go` will be created in the following directory structure:
```sh
/app
  /orders
    /adapter
      /in
        /controller
          - create_order.go
  /payments
    /adapter
      /in
        /controller
          - create_payment_request.go
  /customers
    /adapter
      /in
        /controller
          - create_customer.go
```
