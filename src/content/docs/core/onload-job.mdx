The einar-cli enables you to generate custom onload jobs by automatically generating the necessary files and imports for managing your business logic. These onload jobs will be loaded only when all their dependencies have been satisfied and will be executed only once when the application is run.

## 👨‍💻 Generate a New OnloadJob
Inside your project directory, run the following command to create a new custom usecase:
```sh
einar generate onload-job my-job-name
```

Here's an example of how the generated code will look:
```sh
func init() {
	ioc.Registry(myJobName)
}
func myJobName() {
	//execute your onload job here
}
```
